# Changelog

Honest version history. Each entry documents what works, what was broken, and what was fixed.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed — remaining known issues from 0.5.0
- **`reminders done`** — no `--json` flag. Now returns `{"id", "title", "completed": true, "completion_date"}`.
- **`calendar create --json`** — missing `all_day` field in response. Now always present.
- **`calendar create --all-day`** — date-only strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) were rejected; only `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` was accepted. Now both formats work; `--all-day` with a date-only string defaults end to start+1 day.
- **`notify send`** — no `--json` flag. Now returns `{"sent": true, "title", "body"}`.
- **`info power settings --json`** — returned `{"raw": "..."}` (unparsed pmset blob). Now parses pmset output into structured keys (`displaysleep`, `sleep`, `lowpowermode`, etc.) with correct types (int for numbers, bool for 0/1 flags).
- **`info network --json`** — inconsistent field shape per interface (missing fields instead of nulls). Now always emits `name`, `ipv4`, `mac` with explicit `null` when absent.
- **`ax read`** — required `--app <name>` flag but help text implied positional. Now accepts `apple ax read Finder` (positional) or `--app Finder` (option). Frontmost app when omitted.
- **`system display brightness`** — silently exited 0 when `brightness` CLI was missing. Now exits non-zero with a clear install instruction.

### Known flakiness (not a code bug)
- `apple setup` Mail check occasionally shows ❌ due to JXA permission state in macOS not refreshing immediately after permission grant. `apple mail accounts` works correctly when called directly. Run `apple setup` again if Mail shows red after granting Automation permission.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed — critical hangs
- **`mail search` hangs indefinitely** on large mailboxes — was iterating `m.content()` across every message in every account via JXA with no timeout. Now uses 20s timeout; returns a clear error if exceeded instead of hanging forever.
- **`photos search` hangs indefinitely** on large libraries — same root cause (JXA iterating all items). Fixed with 20s timeout.
- **`info spotlight` hangs on first invocation** — `mdfind` without `--onlyin` triggered a metadata log parse that stalled. Now enforces a 15s timeout and surfaces a helpful error suggesting `--onlyin <dir>`.

### Fixed — JSON correctness
- **`system audio mute`** had no `--json` flag (`--json` returned exit 64). Now returns `{"muted": true/false}` for both get and set.
- **`system audio devices --json`** was returning raw `system_profiler` internal keys (`_name`, `_items`, `coreaudio_*`). Now returns clean fields: `name`, `manufacturer`, `type`, `default_input`, `default_output`, `input_channels`, `output_channels`.
- **`speech voices --json`** — `sample` field included a leading `#` from the `say -v ?` output format separator. Now stripped.
- **`system wifi status --json`** — `mac` field was always `""` (macOS Ventura redacts BSSID in system_profiler). Now omitted when empty rather than returning a misleading empty string.
- **`finder cwd`** — missing `--json` flag. Now returns `{"path": "..."}`.

### Known issues (not yet fixed)
- `info power settings --json` returns `{"raw": "..."}` instead of structured keys
- `info network --json` — inconsistent field shape per interface (no nulls for missing fields)
- `system display brightness` exits 0 when `brightness` CLI is missing — should be non-zero
- `ax read` — requires `--app <name>` flag but help implies positional; confusing UX
- `reminders done` — no `--json` flag
- `calendar create --json` — missing `all_day` field in response
- `notify send` — no `--json` flag

### Changed
- Version reset from inflated 0.9.0 → honest **0.5.0**. 24 subcommands exist but 3 had critical hangs, 8 had JSON bugs, and several lacked `--json` flags. 0.9.0 implied near-release quality; 0.5.0 reflects real state.

---
