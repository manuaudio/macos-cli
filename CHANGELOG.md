## [0.5.7] — 2026-05-19

### Renamed

- Project renamed from `apple-cli` to `macOS CLI`. Binary: `apple` → `macos`. Repo: manuaudio/apple-cli → manuaudio/macos-cli.

### Added — 6 new commands + 2 extensions

- `bluetooth` — list paired devices, connect, disconnect (IOBluetooth.framework)
- `trash` — move file/dir to trash, empty trash, list trash contents
- `spotlight` — search files via mdfind; filter by kind (app/image/pdf/audio/video/document/folder), limit results, scope to directory
- `file` — headless file ops: list directory, copy, move, delete, stat, read text files
- `login-items` — list/add/remove login items via System Events
- `dock` — list/add/remove pinned apps, restart Dock
- `system vpn` — VPN status/connect/disconnect via scutil
- `system display wallpaper` — get current wallpaper per display, set wallpaper on all displays

### Note on notify list/clear

`UNUserNotificationCenter` requires a bundle identifier — it crashes from a non-bundled CLI binary. `notify send` works fine (osascript). `list` and `clear` were removed as they cannot work from a CLI tool without a bundle.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-05-18

### Added — close 4 capability gaps surfaced by the chief/Aura MCP→CLI sweep

- **`apple contacts create/update --job-title`** — first-class job-title field on both create and update. Previously callers had to fold job title into `--note` as `Title: <value>` because the flag didn't exist.
- **`apple calendar reload`** — force Calendar to refresh from iCloud / CalDAV sources. Uses EventKit's `refreshSourcesIfNecessary()` directly (no AppleScript / Calendar.app dependency).
- **`apple mail refresh`** — force Mail.app to check all accounts for new mail. Wraps `tell application "Mail" to check for new mail` AppleScript inside the CLI so callers don't have to construct osascript shell commands themselves.
- **`apple contacts get-note <id>` + `apple contacts set-note <id> --text "..." [--if-empty]`** — read/write the contact note field. macOS 13+ gates `CNContactNoteKey` behind the `com.apple.developer.contacts.notes` entitlement that un-entitled binaries (including apple-cli and pyobjc) can't satisfy. AppleScript routes through Contacts.app — which IS entitled — so we wrap that path inside the CLI for the note field only. Same wrapped-AppleScript pattern as `mail refresh`.

### Why these landed together
Aura's chief codebase did a full MCP→CLI sweep on 2026-05-18 (replacing 8 production scripts that used osascript). Three capability gaps were documented as known limitations during the migration. v0.5.6 closes those gaps so the migrated scripts don't need workarounds.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed — agent usability audit

- **`Process.capture(timeout:)`** — fixed pipe deadlock: commands with large output (e.g. `process list` with 700+ process lines) would fill the 64 KB pipe buffer and hang indefinitely. Pipe is now drained asynchronously in a background handler, unblocking the process and the timeout loop.
- **`apple process list/find`** — added 10s timeout to the `ps -axo` call; was never timing out before (no timeout), causing indefinite hang if ps deadlocked.
- **`apple notes create`** — added 10s timeout to osascript; previously hung forever if Notes Automation permission wasn't granted. Now exits 64 with a clear permission error.
- **`apple calendar delete`** — added `--json` flag; previously returned plain text `"deleted N"` with no JSON output, breaking agents that check exit + parse JSON.
- **`apple music search`** — added `--json` flag; previously had no JSON output mode. Also replaced `music.sources.whose({kind: "library"})` JXA API (fails with -1708 on some Music versions) with `music.tracks()` filter approach. Fixed `jxa()` helper to return nil on empty osascript output instead of passing empty string through.
- **`apple photos recent`** — added 30s timeout to osascript call; previously no timeout, could hang indefinitely on large libraries.
- **`apple photos search`** — increased timeout 20s → 45s for large photo libraries.
- **`apple mail search`** — increased timeout 20s → 45s for large mailboxes.
- **`apple speech voices --json`** — locale field was unreliable (wrong values for some voices due to fragile double-space split). Now uses regex `[a-z]{2}_[A-Z]{2}` to extract locale reliably.

### Agent readiness after this patch
All 30 commands tested. Confirmed: valid JSON on stdout, non-zero exit on error, no hangs. Agents can safely call all commands with a 30–60s timeout wrapper.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-05-18

### Added — 6 new commands (30 total)

- **`shortcuts`** — list and run Apple Shortcuts from the CLI
  - `shortcuts list` — lists all shortcuts (name only, 0 shortcuts if none configured)
  - `shortcuts run <name>` — runs a named shortcut with optional stdin input and 30s timeout
  - `--json` on run returns `{"name", "output"}`

- **`pdf`** — extract text and metadata from PDF files via PDFKit (on-device, no network)
  - `pdf text --path <file>` — extract all text; `--page N` for a single page
  - `pdf info --path <file>` — page count, author, title, creator, created/modified dates, encryption status

- **`focus`** — read and set macOS Focus / Do Not Disturb state
  - `focus status` — returns `{"dnd_active": bool, "modes": [...], "assertion_count": int}`
  - `focus modes` — lists all configured Focus modes with identifiers
  - `focus on [--mode <identifier>]` / `focus off` — read/write Assertions.json directly + SIGHUP donotdisturbd; no legacy defaults hack

- **`process`** — list and kill running processes
  - `process list [--sort cpu|mem|name|pid] [--limit N]` — top N processes by chosen sort key
  - `process find <name>` — substring match across all running processes
  - `process kill --pid N` or `--name <name>` — sends TERM (or `--signal KILL/HUP/etc.`) to matching process(es); `--all` for multiple matches

- **`disk`** — mount, unmount, eject, and inspect volumes
  - `disk list` — all disks and partitions with device, name, size, mount point
  - `disk info <path>` — detailed info for a device path or mount point
  - `disk eject <path>` — eject a volume (safe removal)
  - `disk unmount <path>` — unmount without ejecting; `--force` for busy volumes
  - `disk mount <path>` — mount a device or `.dmg`/`.iso` file

- **`location`** — GPS coordinates via CoreLocation
  - `location get` — returns `{"latitude", "longitude", "accuracy_meters", "timestamp"}`
  - Requires Location Services permission; 15s timeout by default
  - **Known limitation:** requires interactive permission grant on first use; CLI apps show "Command Line Tool" in Location Services

- **`contacts create`** — create a new contact with name, phones, emails, org, note
- **`contacts update <id>`** — add phone/email or update name/org/note on existing contact
- **`contacts delete <id>`** — delete a contact by identifier

### No regressions
All 24 previously-existing commands verified working in this release. Bug fixes from 0.5.1 unchanged.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed — remaining known issues from 0.5.0
- **`reminders done`** — no `--json` flag. Now returns `{"id", "title", "completed": true, "completion_date"}`.
- **`calendar create --json`** — missing `all_day` field in response. Now always present.
- **`calendar create --all-day`** — date-only strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) were rejected; only `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` was accepted. Now both formats work; `--all-day` with a date-only string defaults end to start+1 day.
- **`notify send`** — no `--json` flag. Now returns `{"sent": true, "title", "body"}`.
- **`info power settings --json`** — returned `{"raw": "..."}` (unparsed pmset blob). Now parses pmset output into structured keys (`displaysleep`, `sleep`, `lowpowermode`, etc.) with correct types (int for numbers, bool for 0/1 flags).
- **`info network --json`** — inconsistent field shape per interface (missing fields instead of nulls). Now always emits `name`, `ipv4`, `mac` with explicit `null` when absent.
- **`ax read`** — required `--app <name>` flag but help text implied positional. Now accepts `apple ax read Finder` (positional) or `--app Finder` (option). Frontmost app when omitted.
- **`system display brightness`** — silently exited 0 when `brightness` CLI was missing. Now exits non-zero with a clear install instruction.

### Known flakiness (not a code bug)
- `apple setup` Mail check occasionally shows ❌ due to JXA permission state in macOS not refreshing immediately after permission grant. `apple mail accounts` works correctly when called directly. Run `apple setup` again if Mail shows red after granting Automation permission.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed — critical hangs
- **`mail search` hangs indefinitely** on large mailboxes — was iterating `m.content()` across every message in every account via JXA with no timeout. Now uses 20s timeout; returns a clear error if exceeded instead of hanging forever.
- **`photos search` hangs indefinitely** on large libraries — same root cause (JXA iterating all items). Fixed with 20s timeout.
- **`info spotlight` hangs on first invocation** — `mdfind` without `--onlyin` triggered a metadata log parse that stalled. Now enforces a 15s timeout and surfaces a helpful error suggesting `--onlyin <dir>`.

### Fixed — JSON correctness
- **`system audio mute`** had no `--json` flag (`--json` returned exit 64). Now returns `{"muted": true/false}` for both get and set.
- **`system audio devices --json`** was returning raw `system_profiler` internal keys (`_name`, `_items`, `coreaudio_*`). Now returns clean fields: `name`, `manufacturer`, `type`, `default_input`, `default_output`, `input_channels`, `output_channels`.
- **`speech voices --json`** — `sample` field included a leading `#` from the `say -v ?` output format separator. Now stripped.
- **`system wifi status --json`** — `mac` field was always `""` (macOS Ventura redacts BSSID in system_profiler). Now omitted when empty rather than returning a misleading empty string.
- **`finder cwd`** — missing `--json` flag. Now returns `{"path": "..."}`.

### Known issues (not yet fixed)
- `info power settings --json` returns `{"raw": "..."}` instead of structured keys
- `info network --json` — inconsistent field shape per interface (no nulls for missing fields)
- `system display brightness` exits 0 when `brightness` CLI is missing — should be non-zero
- `ax read` — requires `--app <name>` flag but help implies positional; confusing UX
- `reminders done` — no `--json` flag
- `calendar create --json` — missing `all_day` field in response
- `notify send` — no `--json` flag

### Changed
- Version reset from inflated 0.9.0 → honest **0.5.0**. 24 subcommands exist but 3 had critical hangs, 8 had JSON bugs, and several lacked `--json` flags. 0.9.0 implied near-release quality; 0.5.0 reflects real state.
